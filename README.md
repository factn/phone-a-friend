Being actively used by http://coronaunity.org and https://phoneafriend.care possibly amongst others.


## Community Tech for COVID Mutual Aid Groups

This project was launched as part of the MutualAid.World "#CommunityTech" initiative which is focused on building small solutions such as this (and our ['traveling salesperson solver'](https://github.com/factn/communitytech-tsp-frontend)) that are aimed to help people in COVID 19 response groups with technology solutions as rapidly as possible.

This is to be contrasted with our [#resilience-app](https://github.com/factn/resilience-app) and [#safetraceapi](https://github.com/factn/safetraceapi) initiatives which have a bit more longer time frames.

## What does success look like?

- Be helpful, on the ground, for real world organisers **fast**
- Iterate fast, commit good code and build solutions that work
- Listen to the community groups and through rapid iteration and development learn a lot about their real on the ground needs **right freaking now**
